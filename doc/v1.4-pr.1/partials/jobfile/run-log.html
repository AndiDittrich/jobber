  <h3>Keeping a Log of Job Runs</h3>

  <p>
    The command
    <code>jobber log</code>
    prints out info about previous runs. This info &mdash; the
    <dfn>run log</dfn>
    &mdash; must be kept somewhere, and you can control this in the
    <code>prefs</code>
    section of the jobfile.
  </p>

  <p>You can chose to have Jobber keep the run log in its memory, or write
    it to disk. Please note that, if you chose to keep it in memory, it will be
    lost when the Jobber service stops or restarts.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of keeping the run log in memory:</p>
  <pre>
prefs:
  runLog:
    type: memory
    maxLen: 500</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will keep log entries for no more than the 500 most
    recent runs of any of the user&rsquo;s jobs.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of keeping the run log on disk:</p>
  <pre>
prefs:
  runLog:
    type: file
    path: /var/log/jobber-runs
    maxFileLen: 100m
    maxHistories: 2</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will write run log entries to /var/log/jobber-runs.
    /var/log/jobber-runs will grow to no more than 100 MB, and Jobber will
    rotate it when it gets too big. Jobber will keep up to two of these
    rotated &ldquo;history&rdquo; files (named &ldquo;jobber-runs.1&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;jobber-runs.2&rdquo;). When it is necessary to delete a history file,
    the oldest one will get the axe.</p>

  <p>If the jobfile does not have a <code>runLog</code> entry, then
  Jobber&rsquo;s run log is kept in memory, with a maximum length of 100.</p>
