  <h3>Keeping a Log of Job Runs</h3>

  <p>The <code>jobber log</code> command prints the <dfn>run log</dfn> &mdash; i.e., a log
containing info about previous runs.  By default, the run log only contains the 100 most recent
runs, and it is not written to disk, which means that it will be lost when the Jobber service stops
or restarts.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of keeping the run log in memory:</p>
  <pre>[prefs]
runLog:
    type: memory
    maxLen: 500</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will keep log entries for no more than the 500 most
    recent runs of any of the user&rsquo;s jobs.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of keeping the run log on disk:</p>
  <pre>[prefs]
runLog:
    type: file
    path: /var/log/jobber-runs
    maxFileLen: 100m
    maxHistories: 2</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will write run log entries to /var/log/jobber-runs.
    /var/log/jobber-runs will grow to no more than 100 MB, and Jobber will
    rotate it when it gets too big. Jobber will keep up to two of these
    rotated &ldquo;history&rdquo; files (named &ldquo;jobber-runs.1&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;jobber-runs.2&rdquo;). When it is necessary to delete a history file,
    the oldest one will get the axe.</p>
