<p>
  As with cron, each user can have its own set of jobs, which will be run under
  that user&rsquo;s privileges. A user&rsquo;s jobs are defined in a
  <dfn>jobfile</dfn>
  &mdash; a file named &ldquo;.jobber&rdquo; in the user&rsquo;s home directory.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">IMPORTANT: Jobfiles must be owned
by the user who owns the home directory that contains them, and their
permissions must not allow the owning group or any other users to write
to them (i.e., the permission bits must exclude 022). 
</p>
  
<p>
  Here's an example that defines two jobs:
</p>

<pre>[prefs]
  notifyProgram: /home/foobar/handleError.sh

[jobs]
- name: DailyBackup
  cmd: backup daily
  time: 0 0 13
  onError: Stop
  notifyOnError: true
  notifyOnFailure: false

- name: OffsiteBackup
  cmd: |
    mount /backup/offsite
    mount /backup/linux/weekly
    backup-offsite /backup/linux/weekly/backup-0 linux || exit 1
    umount /backup/linux/weekly
    umount /backup/offsite
  time: 0 0 14 * * 1
  onError: Stop</pre>

<p>
  As shown, there are two sections:
  <code>prefs</code>
  and
  <code>jobs</code>
  . The contents of both sections are <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a>
  documents.

  <h4 class="alert-heading">Tip</h4>

  Run
  <code>jobber init</code>
  to get started &mdash; it will make a do-nothing jobfile in the current
  user&rsquo;s home directory with a bunch of helpful comments that explain how to define jobs and
  other settings.

    If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with YAML: The document in the
    <code>prefs</code>
    section contains a mapping with a single entry. The document in the
    <code>jobs</code>
    section contains a sequence of two mappings: the two line-initial dashes (
    <code>-</code>
    ) mark the beginnings of the two mappings. Within the definition of a
    particular map, each key (e.g.,
    <code>name</code>
    ,
    <code>cmd</code>
    ) must be column-aligned. The value for each key in the maps is a string. In
    this example, the value for the key
    <code>cmd</code>
    in the second map is a multi-line string.
