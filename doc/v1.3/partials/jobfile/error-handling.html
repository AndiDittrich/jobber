  <h3>Error-handling</h3>

  <p>
    When a job (or, specifically, the shell code that the job runs) exited with
    a non-0 status, we call this a <dfn>&ldquo;job error&rdquo;</dfn>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of Jobber&rsquo;s main features is that you can control how Jobber handles job
    errors. You do this by setting the
    <code>onError</code>
    field in a job&rsquo;s definition to one of these values:
  </p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Effect when a job error happens</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Stop</code></td>
        <td>Stop scheduling runs of this job.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Backoff</code></td>
        <td>Schedule runs of this job according to an exponential backoff
          algorithm. If a later run of the job succeeds, jobber resumes
          scheduling this job normally; but if the job continues to err, 
          Jobber will eventually stop scheduling it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Continue</code></td>
        <td>Continue scheduling this job normally.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    When Jobber stops scheduling runs of a job due to one or more job errors, we
    call this a <dfn>&ldquo;job failure&rdquo;</dfn>.
  </p>

  <p>If you would like Jobber to notify you when a job error or job failure
    occurs, do the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Write a <dfn>notify program</dfn> that does whatever you want
      done after a job error or job failure
    </li>
    <li>Set the <code>notifyProgram</code> field in the <code>prefs</code>
      section of the Jobber file to the path to your notify program
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The input that Jobber will send to the notify program is described <a
      href="#notify-programs" target="_self">elsewhere</a>.
