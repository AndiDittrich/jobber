  <h2>Deployment</h2>

  <p itemprop="requirements">
    Jobber is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and it should be
    possible to compile and run it on <span itemprop="operatingSystem">any
      Unix/Linux system</span>.
  </p>

  <p>Note that, although Jobber can be used instead of cron, it is certainly
    possible to run both at the same time.</p>

  <h3>Installation from a Package</h3>

  <p>
    The easiest way to install Jobber is via <a href="/jobber/download">a
      binary package</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Compilation and Installation from Source</h3>

  <p>Instead of installing a binary package, you can certainly compile and
    install Jobber yourself.</p>

  <p>You need a recent version of Go to compile Jobber. So, install Go, pick
    a place for your workspace (say, /path/to/your/workspace), and ensure that
    the environment variable &ldquo;GOPATH&rdquo; includes a path to your
    workspace. Then:</p>

  <pre>cd /path/to/your/workspace
go get github.com/dshearer/jobber
cd src/github.com/dshearer/jobber
git checkout v1.2
make GO_WKSPC=/path/to/your/workspace</pre>

  <p>Jobber consists of two binaries: jobber and jobberd. jobberd is a
    daemon that runs jobs; jobber is a client with which the user can interact
    with jobbberd. After compiling, you&rsquo;ll find them in
    /path/to/your/workspace/bin.</p>

  <p>Now:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make a new, non-login user called &ldquo;jobber_client&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Change jobber&rsquo;s permissions to 04755, and its owner to
      jobber_client:root.</li>
    <li>Change jobberd&rsquo;s permissions to 0755, and its owner to
      root:root.</li>
    <li>Move jobber and jobberd someplace more appropriate (e.g.,
      /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/libexec repectively).</li>
    <li>Ensure that jobberd will get started when your computer boots. Note
      that jobberd does not daemonize itself &mdash; you will need to run it
      with something like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/daemonize">daemonize(1)</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>
