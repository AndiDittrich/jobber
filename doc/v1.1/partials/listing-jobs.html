  <h3>Listing Jobs</h3>

  <p>You can list the jobs for a particular user by logging in as that user
    and doing</p>

  <pre>jobber list</pre>

  <p>This command also shows you the status of each job &mdash; that is,
    whether the job is being scheduled as normal, the exponential backoff
    algorithm is being applied, or the job has failed.</p>

  <p>
    As with the
    <code>reload</code>
    command, you can do the same for all users by adding the
    <code>-a</code>
    option as root.
