  <h2>Deployment</h2>

  <p itemprop="requirements">
    Jobber is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and it should be
    possible to compile and run it on <span itemprop="operatingSystem">any
      Unix/Linux system</span>.
  </p>

  <aside class="alert alert-warning">
    <h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4>
    Privilege-escalation is possible if the OS on which Jobber runs allows
    non-root users to change the owner of a file to another user. Fortunately,
    this is not possible in Linux and is not common in other kinds of Unix.

  <h3>Installation from a Package</h3>

  <p>
    The easiest way to install Jobber is via <a href="/jobber/download">a
      binary package</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Compilation and Installation from Source</h3>

  <p>Instead of installing a binary package, you can certainly compile and
    install Jobber yourself.</p>

  <p>You need Go 1.11 or later to compile Jobber. So, install Go, pick a
    place for your workspace (say, /path/to/your/workspace), and ensure that the
    environment variable <code>GOPATH</code> includes a path to your workspace.
    Then:</p>

  <pre>cd /path/to/your/workspace
mkdir -p src/github.com/dshearer
cd src/github.com/dshearer
git clone https://github.com/dshearer/jobber.git
cd jobber
git checkout v1.4-pr.1
make check
sudo make install DESTDIR=/</pre>

  <p>This will install the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>/usr/local/bin/jobber</li>
    <li>/usr/local/libexec/jobbermaster</li>
    <li>/usr/local/libexec/jobberrunner</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Finally, do something to ensure that jobbermaster runs as a daemon (as root)
    when your computer boots. Note that jobbermaster does not daemonize itself,
    but that should not be a problem if you use systemd; otherwise, <a
      href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/daemonize">daemonize(1)</a> could help.
  </p>
