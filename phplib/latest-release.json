1.4 is a large release.  Jobber now supports \"result sinks\" --- configuration options that let you direct job results to files, programs, or network sockets.  Also, Jobber can now be controlled via a network socket using JSON-RPC.  This makes it easy to run Jobber in a Docker container and control it from outside the container.\r\n\r\nEnhancements:\r\n* (#25) pref/jobOutput: Write job output to disk.\r\n* (#182) Direct passthru of stdout/stderr from tasks to parent (for Docker)\r\n* (#183) jobberrunner: Support receiving commands from network socket in JSON\r\n* (#184) cmd/set_job: Make\r\n* (#185) cmd/delete_job: Make\r\n* (#186) Use concept of \"result sinks\" for result notifications and writing output to disk\r\n* (#187) Make result sink that pushes results over socket connection\r\n* (#216) Reduce verbosity of jobberrunner task output\r\n\r\nBugfixes: none"}
